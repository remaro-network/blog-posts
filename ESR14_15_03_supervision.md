# Supervision

Depending on the country, the funding of the project and the field you work in, your supervisor might already have a clear idea of what you should do and achieve in your PhD project, you might be completely free to explore the research field and choose a topic that you find interesting, or something in between. In any case, it is important that you work on something you are interested in and passionate about, otherwise, the next three (or more) years will be very difficult. If you are also a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellow, the description of your project will be rather short and leave room for interpretation, so try to shape the project to your own strengths and interests. Of course, you should also consult your supervisors in this process and trust their opinions. But ultimately, *you* will work on this project so you have to like what you are working with. 

## Relationship with your supervisors

Supervision works differently for everyone and can also change during your PhD. Some students prefer regular meetings with their supervisors while others like to work mostly by themselves and only meet with their supervisors occasionally. You should try to find out which style suits you best and ask (repeatedly if necessary) for the supervision you need. 

No matter the style, you should try to establish a good relationship with your supervisors. If that is not possible and you feel like something is straining your relationship, try to discuss it with your supervisors. Many problems can be solved in this way. However, if you feel that the problems are too severe or you cannot talk to your supervisors about them, then reach out for help to someone else. Universities have designated people you can contact in these situations who will support you. Do not wait too long to seek external help as the situation often worsens over time. If there is no way to solve the issues you have with your supervisor, it is also possible to change supervisors. This is not something that should be taken lightly, among other things because it involves finding a new supervisor, getting a new contract and probably also moving to a new city. Nevertheless, it might be necessary in some cases, and it proved to be the only solution for a few of us. In these cases, the network was very helpful in accommodating the change of supervisors.

## Meetings

During the meetings with our supervisors, we realised that it is always good to have a realistic agenda to structure the meeting and make it more productive. This will make it easier for you to discuss everything you would like to talk about and not waste time diving into unnecessary details. Furthermore, it is important to be direct and concise to make it easier for your supervisors to understand you. If you face a problem and already have a preferred solution in mind, do not tell them only the problem but also your ideas to solve it. This will increase the probability that you will get your way. Your supervisors might have a different opinion, but, from our experience, they will mostly let you try your approach if they see you are confident that you can solve the problem. When you make important decisions, ensure that your supervisors agree with you on the decision. Try to have their confirmation via email so that you can show them the email later in case they doubt the decision – after all, they are also only people and can forget things.

## Formalities

At the beginning of your PhD, it is important to align your and your supervisor’s expectations. Clarify what the requirements are for you to finish your PhD, both in terms of the number of publications and in terms of other requirements like teaching, supervision or obligatory coursework. Agree with your supervisor on a list of your responsibilities to not get surprised by unexpected tasks. You have a say in defining your tasks and can focus on improving your weaknesses as well as playing your strengths. The rights and duties of a PhD student vary from country to country and by the funding you get, but you should make sure that you know about them from the beginning. Later in the PhD, don’t be afraid of fighting for your rights.
