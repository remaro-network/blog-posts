What sets SubPipe apart is its detailed annotations and comprehensive sensor suite. The RGB images and side-scan sonar data are meticulously annotated for object detection and segmentation, providing a rich resource for developing and testing advanced computer vision algorithms in challenging underwater conditions.


## Why SubPipe Matters

The underwater environment poses unique challenges for computer vision. Poor visibility, light scattering, and the uniformity of the seabed can all hinder performance. Traditionally, sonar-based methods have dominated underwater localization and detection. However, with the advent of deep learning, there is a growing potential to push the boundaries of what vision-based algorithms can achieve underwater.

SubPipe addresses a critical gap in the availability of high-quality, annotated underwater datasets. Unlike other domains like autonomous driving, where datasets are plentiful, underwater datasets are scarce due to the difficulty and cost of collecting data in such an environment. SubPipe paves the way for significant advancements in underwater computer vision research by providing a publicly available dataset with comprehensive ground truth data.

## The Power of Collaboration

One of the remarkable aspects of SubPipe is its collaborative spirit. The dataset and experiments are freely accessible online, inviting researchers and developers worldwide to contribute and innovate. By benchmarking state-of-the-art algorithms on SubPipe, the research community can better understand the challenges and opportunities presented by underwater computer vision, leading to more robust and versatile solutions.
